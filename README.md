The project called "Site_BNHA" is my first HTML/CSS site and it was made in 2020. It shows some information about the anime "Boku no Hero Academia" and that's its only utility. 

The project called "restaurante_piepyrus" is a fictional restaurant inspired by the indie game "Undertale" and its character "Papyrus". Its design isn't so good, but it has a lot of divs and inputs. It also has the error "float:center" (I really didn't know "float:center" doesn't exist and it's actually funny).

The project called "site_veiculos" is a fictional concessionaire and it was made with some functions in JavaScript. There are three scripts because the codes weren't working well and I tried to solve the problems with different reasoning.
